How I Approach Designing Software

When approaching software design, I focus on breaking complex problems into manageable components and planning how those components will interact before writing code. Working on this project strengthened my ability to think visually and structurally, especially when designing a 3D scene that required careful placement of objects, camera positioning, lighting, and materials. I followed an iterative design process that began with basic geometry and layout, then gradually layered in textures, lighting, and interaction. This approach allowed me to test ideas early and refine them based on visual feedback. These design tactics—incremental complexity, visual validation, and intentional layout—are transferable to future projects involving user interfaces, simulations, or interactive systems.

How I Approach Developing Programs

Throughout development, I relied on incremental implementation and frequent testing to ensure stability as new features were added. Rather than building everything at once, I focused on getting each component working correctly before moving forward. Iteration played a significant role, especially as I refined transformations, lighting behavior, and collision logic across milestones. Over time, my development approach evolved to emphasize cleaner structure, modular code, and clearer separation between rendering, logic, and interaction. This progression ultimately led to a more complete and maintainable final project.

How Computer Science Helps Me Reach My Goals

Computational graphics and visualization have expanded my understanding of how mathematical concepts, programming, and visual design intersect. These skills are valuable in my future educational path, particularly in areas such as game development, simulation, and interactive visualization. Professionally, this experience provides a strong foundation for working with graphics engines and creating visually engaging applications, reinforcing my broader goal of building practical, technically sound software systems.
